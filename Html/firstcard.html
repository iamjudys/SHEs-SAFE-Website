        <p>"Run Like a Girl" is a phrase that has historically been used as an insult, implying weakness or inferiority.</p>
        <p>A famous example is the 2014 Always campaign titled "Like a Girl", which challenged gender stereotypes by showing how young girls see running,<p>
        <p> throwing, or fighting "like a girl" as something strong and capable, while older individuals often mimic it as weak or silly.<p>
        <p> The campaign encouraged people to rethink the phrase and celebrate female strength in all aspects of life.<p>
